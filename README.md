Welcome to My Portfolio!

This is my personal portfolio created using Node.js, Express, and EJS. It showcases my experience, as well as a bit about my hobbies and projects. 

The page has four pages- Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. I have used Bootstrap 5 for layout and responcivenss, and Font Awesome for icons. Used some of my favrite colours for linear gradients buttons. And i like checkers, so have a personal aesthic background. The code is fully styles wuth Bootstrap classes.

To get the classes for bootstrap, I used the following websites:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/

https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp

https://bootstrapshuffle.com/classes

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/colors/

https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/grids/#justify

To make the website I refrenced the following videoes for ideas on what to add and how to structer. I didnt take any code from the soures, but will add links of videos i got ideas from:
